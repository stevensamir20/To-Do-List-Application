# Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List Application built with React. The purpose of this project was to practice CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations using Axios and live JSON server.

## Features

* **CRUD Operations:** The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks from a todo list. Axios is used to handle HTTP requests to the server.
* **Live JSON Server:** The application uses a live JSON server to store and retrieve task data. This allows for real-time updates and ensures that the data is always up-to-date.
* **Filtering and Sorting:** The application allows users to filter tasks by completion status and sort tasks by due date or priority.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run npm run start:db to start the live JSON server.
4. Run npm start to start the development server.
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.
